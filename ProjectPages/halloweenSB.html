                    <h2>The Project: A Physical/Digital Hybrid Game</h2>
                    <p>
                        The final project for our "Game Design" class was to create a Halloween-themed game for a local elementary school. We designed a physical/digital tower defense game based on a 
                        custom-built skeeball machine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A critical design goal was to ensure the game was fun **with or without** the digital portion. This way, if any bugs or issues arose, the core physical game would 
                        still be a complete, fun experience for the kids.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Players roll physical balls up the skeeball ramp.</li>
                        <li>Sensors in the holes detect which lane the ball entered.</li>
                        <li>This sensor data is fed to a Unity game, which "shoots" a digital projectile down the corresponding lane.</li>
                        <li>Players must hit monsters in the lanes to collect "candy" (points) and prevent them from reaching the home base.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="project-section">
                    <h2>The Process: Leadership Under Pressure</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The Goal & The Challenge:</strong> As a class, we designed the project, but we were suddenly informed that our presentation date was moved upâ€”we had 
                        just **four days** to physically and digitally build, code, test, and present the entire game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>My Role as Project Manager:</strong> I stepped in to lead the project.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I divided the class into groups, assigning tasks based on their known strengths and interests.</li>
                        <li>I acted as the central hub, coordinating all teams, collecting files, and managing the schedule.</li>
                        <li>I led the physical fabrication, staying the final night **until 5 AM** to complete the assembly, often working by myself when others were unavailable. I particuarly enjoyed assembling sensors as I have worked extesnivly with arduino in the past.</li>
                        <li>We successfully transported and assembled the full game at the elementary school, tested it, and presented it to the students the next day.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        My motivation for working so hard stemmed from really wanting to deliver a fun experience for our users. I learned that while a team helps a project thrive, 
                        a leader must work to get the details hammered out so that everything else can slide right into place. Prepping and bringing everyone together was a real joy and made a 
                        super stressful project feel incredibly fulfilling.
