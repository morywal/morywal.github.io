                    <h2>The Project: A Spoiler-Free AI Helper</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The Problem:</strong> I often start a game, run out of time to play, and put it down for months. When I come back, I remember the core story but have forgotten 
                        crucial details like names, places, and side quests.
                    </spp>
                    <p>
                        <strong>My Solution:</strong> I built a standalone AI chatbot that integrates with the RetroArch emulator. The bot reads data from the emulator's console and tracks the 
                        player's progress. When the player asks a question, the AI cross-references their progress with a game-data (JSON) file to provide a <strong>spoiler-free, context-aware</strong> 
                        answer.

                    <h2>The Retro Helper Integration</h2>
                    <p>
                        The application was built as an add-on to RetroArch, which required me to research its documentation to understand how to read its console output in real-time.

                        This was my Capstone project, showcasing my heavy programming and design skills. This took months to research, design, and implement. It was a real 
                        challenge, especially since it was my first time really delving into Git documents to learn and use other people's collaborative tools.
                    </spp>
                    <p>
                        I want to polish and **publish** this app in its entirety one day, as I still have this problem with other games. It was the culmination of my CS degree.
