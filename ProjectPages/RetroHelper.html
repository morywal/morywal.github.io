                    <strong>My Role:</strong> Co-Founder, Event Designer, & Project Manager
                </p>
                <p>
                    I co-founded and designed 'Fusion Fest,' a 48-hour multimedia jam, to foster a new culture of collaboration within the CLU Multimedia program. My role involved pitching the concept to faculty, designing the event structure, and mentoring student teams. The event was a major success and is now an annual tradition.

                <h2>The Process: From Pitch to Event</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Challenge:</strong> The multimedia program had many talented students but lacked a high-energy, collaborative event to bring them together and build community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>My Solution:</strong> I designed 'Fusion Fest' to solve this. My responsibilities included:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Writing the initial pitch and design document to get faculty buy-in.</li>
                    <li>Designing the theme, creative constraints, and judging criteria.</li>
                    <li>Structuring the 48-hour schedule to balance work-time with mentorship.</li>
                    <li>Managing event logistics and communication with student teams.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Impact: A New Tradition</h2>
                <p>
                    The first Fusion Fest was a huge success, with over 30 students participating and 10 projects completed. Based on the positive feedback, the multimedia department adopted it as an <strong>annual tradition</strong>, which was my ultimate goal and proudest achievement from this project.
