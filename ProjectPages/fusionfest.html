                <h2>The Project: A Multimedia Jam</h2>
                <p>
                    I co-founded and designed 'Fusion Fest,' a 48-hour multimedia jam, to foster a new culture of collaboration within the CLU Multimedia program. My role involved pitching the 
                    concept to faculty, designing the event structure, and mentoring student teams. The event was a major success and is now an annual tradition.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-section">
                <h2>The Process: From Pitch to Event</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Challenge:</strong> I felt personally frustrated that we didn't have strong portoflios including more personal works. I also wanted projects that could help future 
                    students learn initiative for their future capstones. The multimedia program has many talented students but lacked a high-energy, collaborative event to bring them together and 
                    both build community as well as learn personal project development skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>My Solution:</strong> I designed 'Fusion Fest' to solve this. My responsibilities included:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Writing the initial pitch and design document to get faculty buy-in.</li>
                    <li>Designing the theme, creative constraints, and judging criteria.</li>
                    <li>Structuring the 48-hour into an 1-2 week schedule to balance work-time with class time.</li>
                    <li>Managing event logistics and hands-off guidance.</li>
                    <li>Creating an event that could be easily recreated and used in the future after I leave.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The first Fusion Fest was a huge success, with over 60 students participating and 19 projects completed. Based on the positive feedback, the multimedia department adopted 
                    it as an <strong>Semester tradition</strong>, which was my ultimate goal and proudest achievement from this project.
