                    <h2>The Project: An Economic Bubble</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The Prompt:</strong> For the 2025 Global Game Jam, our team was given the theme **"Bubbles."**
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Our Solution:</strong> We interpreted this as **"economic bubbles."** In 48 hours, we designed "Overblown!," a quippy stock trading roguelike. We thought it would 
                        be fun to let players orchestrate a bubble for their own stock and take down competitors trying to do the same.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We created a stock game with multiple shops for Marketing, Research, Black Market, and Loans.</li>
                        <li>Each choice could benefit the player (raise stock value) or harm them (Black Market could hurt your reputation).</li>
                        <li>I also created a simple AI to play alongside the player.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>My Role & Contributions</h2>
                    <p>
                        My job was to create the enemy AI, the general game loop, 
                        as well as the game's central win/loss condition. I also acted as Project Manager, helping to assemble all the visual and audio pieces 
                        into the final build.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I created a "GameManager" script that runs the game systems (turn order, win/loss checks).</li>
                        <li>Within the Game Manager I also implented the basic AI </li>
                        <li>I compiled all the external files from other group members (art, music) and integrated them into the final Unity project.</li>

                                <li>Calls "ChooseAICardType()" as a random generator (as we did not have time to implement educated moves).</li>
                                <li>It then asks the card manager to check for cards.</li>
                                <li>It filters out all choices based on how much money it has, then picks a card at random.</li>
                                <li>If it's a "Black Market" card, it can choose an opponent to use it on.</li>
                                <li>Then it plays the card.</li>

                    <p>
                        This was my first ever Game Jam and I learned a lot. I had to take up a leadership role again, being the main form of communication among the team and doing a lot of the 
                        programming myself.
                    </spp>
                    <p>
                        It was a challenge because I had to read and understand other people's code, but I was able to ask questions and work it out. I learned teamwork under a crunch.
