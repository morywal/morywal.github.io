            <p>Hello My name is Maxim Orywal (He/Him)</p>
            <p>I'm a current student at CLU graduating 2025. Im pursuing a Computer Science Major and a Multimedia Minor</p>
            <h1>Goals</h1>
            <p>I hope to work on projects that interest me as well as create code and art that I believe in making</p>
            <h1>My Story</h1>
            <p>I was a big Soccer player growing up and did nothing but until High School when I started to diversify my interests into Art, Coding and Sports. </p>
            <p> Senior Year of High School I got injured and could not continue playing into college. That is when I got more into coding and decided to pursue it as a career, especially concerning <b>Robotics</b>. Around Junior year I had taken a ton of classes and none interested me more (besides CS) than multimedia. I studied a lot of the <b>Adobe</b> programs before settling into a <b>Cinema 4D</b> class and fell in love with 3D modeling</p>
            <p>Im an ESFP Personality Type and I love working with people. I was given the nickname of "Over Achiever" by my friends because I try to complete work and aissgnments to my 100% completion which is oftentimes beyond what people go for</p>
